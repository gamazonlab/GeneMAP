Abstract

Organisms maintain metabolic homeostasis through the combined functions of small molecule transporters and enzymes. While many of the metabolic components have been well-established, a substantial number remains without identified physiological substrates. To bridge this gap, we leverage large-scale plasma metabolome genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to develop a multiomic Gene-Metabolite Associations Prediction (GeneMAP) discovery platform. GeneMAP can generate accurate predictions, even pinpointing genes that are distant from the variants implicated by GWAS. In particular, our work identified SLC25A48 as a genetic determinant of plasma choline levels. Mechanistically, SLC25A48 loss strongly impairs mitochondrial choline import and synthesis of its downstream metabolite, betaine. The rare variant testing and polygenic risk score analysis elucidates choline-relevant phenomic consequences of SLC25A48 dysfunction, including musculoskeletal and digestive disorders. Altogether, our study proposes SLC25A48 as a mitochondrial choline transporter and provides a discovery platform for metabolic gene function.
